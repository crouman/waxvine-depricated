  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>The <em>primary</em> use of buttons is for submitting data and confirming actions as it relates specifically to data entry. Some common examples are "Save", "OK", and "Cancel" which are typically found within forms and dialogs as part of a user's workflow. </p>
<p>We realize that there are some other cases where buttons are used, but in the strictest sense buttons should be used for use cases that involve the following broad interactions:<br />
<ul>
  <li>saving data</li>
  <li>retrieving data</li>
  <li>uploading data</li>
  <li>downloading data</li>
  <li>confirming actions</li>
  <li>and that's it</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Now you may be thinking that this is too restrictive but you would be wrong. You can tweet and poke your friends 'til next week with just those five interactions.</p>

<h2>	When to use</h2>
<p>Use buttons any time the user needs to complete an interaction. Such cases include pushing and pulling data from a server (e.g. saving, searching), confirming intent (e.g. deleting, closing), exporting/importing, printing, copying, tweeting, poking, annoying, etc. </p>

<h2>When not to use</h2>
<p>Don't use buttons for navigation. Hyperlinks are used for navigation and in most cases they should be used as such.</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p><em>content goes here</em></p>

<h2>Best practices</h2>
<p>Try not to use hyperlinks in place of buttons. Hyperlinks are used for navigation, but are often misappropriated as buttons. Doing this can create confusion for the user as it violates their expectations for these components.  </p>
