	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>Auto-suggest presents a list of suggested values that match the user’s input. The list of matching options is reduced as the user continues to type into the field. However, a user’s input is not limited to only the options presented in the list. The user always has the option of providing their own value.</p>
	
	<h2>When to use</h2>
	<p>When lists are very long but the values are familiar to the user such as countries and states, auto-complete works well. This is especially the case if your user can locate a value without needing to see the entire list. But values don’t have to be as generic as country and states. It’s also great for more esoteric values such as industry specific terms or codes that only your users might know.</p>
        <p>Auto-complete also works well if the business requirements allows for unique values. In other words, the user can provide their own value if a predefined value does not work as well.</p>
        <p>Since our solution allows for a more enhanced display of data (as compared to a typical drop-down list), you may consider auto-complete. This is especially important if your users need to see more than a single piece of data in order to differentiate the list options (e.g locating a single location among groups of geographic regions).</p>
	
<h2>When not to use</h2>
	<p>Ensure that list values are distinguishable from one another. If list entries are highly repetitive, auto-suggest loses its usefulness (e.g. if there are 50 entries that start “ABC Corp”).</p>
	
	<h2>Best Practices</h2>
	<p>Present no more than three related data elements per list value. Although it can pull together and present separate pieces of data in a single list value, presenting more than three values per line may actually make it more difficult for a user to differentiate the options because there is more data to scan.</p>
