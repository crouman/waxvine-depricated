	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>Auto-suggest presents a list of suggested values that match the user’s input. The list of matching options is reduced as the user continues to type into the field. However, a user’s input is not limited to only the options presented in the list. The user always has the option of providing their own value.</p>
	
	<h2>When to use</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If your user is able to select from a list of predefined values, OR provide a new value that is not already in the list.</li>
		<li>If your&nbsp;user&nbsp;does not need to see all of the values in the list at once in order to make the correct choice.</li>
		<li>If your&nbsp;user&nbsp;needs to see more than a single piece of data in order to differentiate the list options.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>When not to use</h2>
	<p>The solution loses its usefulness if list entries are highly repetitive.</p>
	
	<h2>Best Practices</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure that list values are distinguishable from one another. If list entries are highly repetitive, auto-suggest loses its usefulness. For example, if there are 100 entries that start “XYZ Corp.”</li>
		<li>Present no more than three related data elements per list value. Although the auto-suggest component can pull together and present separate pieces of data in a single list value, presenting more than three values per line may actually make it more difficult for a user to differentiate the options because there is more data to scan.</li>
	</ul>
