	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>Auto-suggest predicts the word or phrase that a User wishes to provide before the User has typed the value in completely. The system presents a list of suggested values that match the User’s partial input. As the User continues to type into the field, the list of matching options is reduced. However, the auto-suggest component does not limit a User’s input to only the options in the list. The User may select from the list of suggested options, or the User may continue to type a new/different value into the text field.</p>
	<h2>Problem being solved</h2>
	<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nam ac tortor velit, id ornare urna. Aenean feugiat sagittis neque ut porta. Nullam quis lacus quis neque ullamcorper dictum.</p>
	<h2>Why you would use it</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If your user is able to select from a list of predefined values, OR provide a new value that is not already in the list.</li>
		<li>If your&nbsp;user&nbsp;does not need to see all of the values in the list at once in order to make the correct choice.</li>
		<li>If your&nbsp;user&nbsp;needs to see more than a single piece of data in order to differentiate the list options.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Why you would <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> use it</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If list entries are highly repetitive, auto-suggest loses its usefulness</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Also known as</h2>

	<h2>Relates to</h2>
	<p>Textbox, Textarea</p>
	<h2>Best Practices</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Ensure that list values are distinguishable from one another.&nbsp;</strong>If list entries are highly repetitive, auto-suggest loses its usefulness. For example, if there are 100 entries that start “XYZ Corp.”</li>
		<li><strong>Present no more than three related data elements per list value.&nbsp;</strong>Although the auto-suggest component can pull together and present separate pieces of data in a single list value (e.g. Branch Code, Branch Name and Country), presenting more than three values per line may actually make it more difficult for a User to differentiate the options because there is more data to scan.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Usability</h2>
	<p>Our tests indicate that users generally have little issue using this component.&nbsp;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nam ac tortor velit, id ornare urna. Aenean feugiat sagittis neque ut porta. Nullam quis lacus quis neque ullamcorper dictum.</p>
